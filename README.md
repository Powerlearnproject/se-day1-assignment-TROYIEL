Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The NATO Software Engineering Conference
In the early days of computing (1950s–1960s), software development lacked structure, leading to inefficiencies and failures known as the "software crisis."
In 1968, the NATO Software Engineering Conference was held in Germany, where the term "software engineering" was formally introduced.
This milestone emphasized the need for applying engineering principles to software development, focusing on structured design, documentation, and project management.
Impact
Encouraged systematic software development practices.
Led to the adoption of methodologies such as the Waterfall model for structured software development.

2. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
The Agile Manifesto
Traditional software development models, like Waterfall, struggled with adaptability, leading to delays and project failures.
In 2001, a group of software developers created the Agile Manifesto, introducing principles like iterative development, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.
Agile methods such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP) became widely adopted.
Impact
Shifted focus from rigid, document-heavy processes to flexible, customer-centric development.
Enabled faster releases and continuous improvement through iterative development cycles.
Paved the way for DevOps and CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) practices.

3. The Advent of Cloud Computing & DevOps (2010s – Present)
Widespread adoption of cloud computing and DevOps
The rise of cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud revolutionized software deployment and scalability.
DevOps (Development + Operations) emerged as a methodology to integrate development and IT operations, enabling faster and more reliable software delivery.
Impact
Enabled global-scale applications with on-demand infrastructure.
Improved automation, monitoring, and continuous delivery of software.
Transformed how businesses build, deploy, and maintain software with microservices, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and serverless computing.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
The initial phase where project goals, feasibility, budget, and timeline are defined.
Key activities include requirement analysis, risk assessment, and resource allocation.

2. Requirement Analysis
Involves gathering and analyzing user and business requirements.
Functional and non-functional requirements are documented in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS).

3. Design
Software architects and developers create the system architecture, UI/UX design, and database structure.
High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) are developed.
4. Implementation (Coding & Development)
The actual coding takes place based on the design documents.
Developers write, compile, and integrate code while following coding standards.

5. Testing
The software is tested for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
Types of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

6. Deployment
The tested software is deployed to production or released for customer use.
It may be deployed in phases (gradual rollout) or as a full release.

7. Maintenance & Support
The software is monitored for issues, and updates or patches are applied to fix bugs or improve performance.
Includes adaptive maintenance (upgrades) and corrective maintenance (bug fixes).

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology
Characteristics:
Linear and sequential approach.
Divided into fixed phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
Minimal customer involvement after the requirement phase.
Testing occurs only after the development phase is completed.
Requires detailed documentation before development.
Entire software is delivered at once after completion.

Advantages
Well-structured and easy to manage.
Works well for projects with fixed requirements.
Clearly defined milestones and documentation.
Suitable for large teams with well-established processes.

Disadvantages
Inflexible to changes once the project starts.
High risk of late-stage errors, leading to costly fixes.
Delayed customer feedback, which may result in unmet expectations.
Testing is done late, increasing the chance of critical defects.


Agile Methodology
Characteristics:
Iterative and incremental approach.
Work is divided into short cycles called sprints (1-4 weeks).
High customer involvement with continuous feedback.
Testing happens throughout development (continuous integration and testing).
Less emphasis on documentation, more focus on working software.
Software is delivered in small, functional increments.
Advantages:
Highly flexible to changes and evolving requirements.
Early risk detection due to continuous testing and iteration.
Faster delivery of working features.
Encourages collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and users.

Disadvantages
Requires strong team communication and coordination.
Can lead to scope creep (expanding project scope).
Less focus on documentation, which may cause issues in long-term maintenance.
Not ideal for projects with strict regulatory requirements
